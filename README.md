# Excel-analysis
This project includes sales data for 2021 in four regions- North, South, East, and West in US. 
This analysis looked into the commission to be paid for the salesperson who met or exceeded the monthly sales target. 
Analyze also include monthly total sales, the highest and lowest sales according to region and month.
Finally, I look into the difference between targeted sales and sales amount which is nearly 1.5 million dollars.
